The software architecture defines the parts of the software and it is also the technology strategy of a project/product. It is very important for the users to see constant updates because, without them, failures may happen.

### Architecture documentation 
Documenting a project's architecture takes time, knowledge of tools, and layout techniques. The biggest challenge is to avoid two scenarios: 

- **Scenario 1:** Complex documentation can be confusing and obsolete and it loses the main purpose and it is a waste of time to produce something it won't be used. 

- **Scenario 2:** Documents with flaws and not enough information.

In both cases, the final result can confuse the user. 

The project's architecture is crucial for the user to have a better experience, so it is important to document because it answers questions like: 
- How does my system integrate between itself and other systems? 
- How can I escalate my application? 
- How can I assure my application's security? 

After all this, CharlesCD's team created a view of our architecture in a simpler way, the C4 Model.


## **What is a C4Model?**

The C4 model was created by Simon Brown, it is based on 4+1 and UML. The model helps to solve architecture problems in the documentation, it is divided into 4 diagrams, each one has a different detail level to a specific audience. The idea is to bring a clearer view of the project deep diving at every level. 


## **What is CharlesCD?**

Charles is an open-source tool that performs deployment in a continuous, agile, and safe way. It allows the development teams to make hypotheses validations with specific user groups.

The project brings a new concept to the market and to the community: deployment in users' circles in Kubernetes clusters.

In this deployment model, it is possible to segment your clients through specific characteristics and submit several versions of the same application to test with circle's users.
